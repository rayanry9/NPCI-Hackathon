## Problem Statement

> ### Unified Reward Systems
>
> Many apps and shops offer reward points to loyal customers. These points can only be used at those respective shops / apps. From the customer point of view, it would be beneficial to merge reward points or use them across sellers.

## Brief Summary of our Solution

Our solution to the unifying reward points across many businesses involves selling reward points to businesses, which lets them set up their own methods of distributing these points to consumers. The manner in which they distribute these points can boost their customer base and loyalty as these customers will be inclined to shop at businesses that provide better rewards. Together with a robust UPI integration, that guarantees a seamless experience and addresses safety concerns, our app provides a modern paradigm of online shopping.
